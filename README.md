# Graal Files

Hi! I'm Zed. I created this page because I got nostalgic and wanted to revisit Graal. Unfortunately, the Graal of today is very scary. I wanted the old version. This website is a list of all the files I've managed to locate. This site only links to the files. No files are hosted here.

This page is created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), using the [Sidey theme](https://github.com/ronv/sidey).

You are free to fork this site and make your own version.

There was and is no reason to keep this site open. If someone wants to run their own Graal site with graal stuff there is nothing stopping them from doing so. You can lead horses to water but you can’t make them drink. Give a man a fish you feed him for a day teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime. It’s time people drank their own water and caught their own fish.</p><p>There were many good people and good things related to Graal, after all it was merely a multi player online Zelda style game with player made content “what could go wrong?” Most of the original 1st and 2nd gen Graal people like Clops, Zeek Silverfire, Zol, Cobra 5.0, Kyle0654, Sir Pickles, ShockedFrog, Mr. Hack and dozens of others were good people who were cool to hang out with and made good things.</p><p>Graal could’ve been a decent game 20 years ago had it not been for the stupid cancerous people who are mentally ill, perverts, violent deranged psychopaths, ugly people, liars, thieves and scammers who are failures “I think most who read this know who I’m referring to” and a small French guy only thinking of ways to exploit and abuse it’s player base for a few more euros and bread loaves.</p><p>Then you had the those who ruined the game; the people that flooded the game with unaesthetic garbage that was literally made in 10 seconds in MSPaint and copy paste flooded in level editor.</p><p>Such bad content and people would’ve never made it online except for the fact they really sucked up to the French guy and that Graal also had a serious lack of content and copyright problems they wanted to replace with anything else no matter how bad it might’ve been.</p><p>They accepted crap from mentally ill low IQ low talent people. Everyone of the time observed the transformation between 2000 and 2004 that happened to GraalOnline “Graal Classic” What people saw was a mix of some decent people making some decent things with garbage made from a low talent people with a bad egos who felt entitled and like they owned Graal. That story has repeated itself in what’s left of GraalOnline until today.</p><p>Another example of that is the New World project that had a whole new original world, original graphics, music, content, everything was new and it seemed pretty great, however it was entirely scrapped and slapped in to Graal Kingdoms and Graal2001 which were both worse and awful parts of Graal that are undisputedly the least popular and most hated Playerworlds and content in GraalOnline.</p><p>Take a look in the Graal New World betas then take a look at Graal Kingdoms or Graal2001 to see firsthand how Stephane and other bad people don’t care about quality, but rather ripping off content and turning the works of good people like Kyle0654 and the rest of the New World team into trash. This has also been done to Unholy Nations, Era, X Online and pretty much every other Playerworld, Graal developer and all of PC Graal. This is why Graal is dead.</p><p>This site was not deleted because of Stephane’s false and fraudulent DMCA complaints; I successfully refuted them and sent in an official DMCA Counter Notice. Rather I myself deleted everything because of the reason I gave in the first paragraph of this page. Graal is best left to be forgotten and what’s left of it to slowly die off and in 5 or 10 years Stephane will run out of money to pay for his 110 euro a night Mauritius hotel and he will either be extradited to the United States or Europe to face charges for Cyber Crimes, Tax Evasion and Fraud in France, U.S.A., E.U. and INTERPOL or the Mauritius “Guvna” will deal with him appropriately after he fails to pay his debts.</p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2018-05-22T00:00:00+10:00">May 22, 2018</time></span></section></main></body></html>
